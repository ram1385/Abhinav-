    consider,canteens must be better orgamished and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online menus 
     with photographs of the meals prepared,and detailed descriptions of their imgredients help both student and
    parents make  the right nutritional choices.Each student or staff member who accesses the  canteen  could be
    provided with  a  School  Canteen Account on the school  website  that keeps track of their  previous meal choices
    and any dietary requirements they may have . Ordering by ticking a box and paying or meals online <canvas>
        eliminate all the fuss of money handling,making it safer and less complicated for staff and student alike.
        Here again, diversity is the key.</p>
